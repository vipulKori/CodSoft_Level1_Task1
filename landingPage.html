            <p class="msg">
                Agera means “to take action” in Swedish, and is also an
                abbreviation of Ageratos, ancient Greek for “ageless” – both
                suitable descriptors for this incredible and beautiful
                machine. The Agera features a unique 7-speed transmission
                with an E-diff and wet clutch functionality developed
                in-house at Koenigsegg, resulting in a system that truly
                enhances performance and handling. It's also fitted with a
                new interior, featuring the now-famous ‘ghost’ lighting
                system characterized by interior symbols created with
                laser-etched, virtually invisible nano-holes punctured
                through the aluminum panels and buttons.</p>

            <p class="msg">
                The Regera was specifically designed to be a luxury
                megacar alternative to Koenigsegg’s traditional extreme,
                lightweight, race-like road-legal cars. It combines a
                powerful twin-turbo V8 combustion engine with three
                electric motors and cutting-edge battery power via new
                powertrain technology called the Koenigsegg Direct Drive.

                While traditional Koenigseggs have always had surprising
                levels of practicality, creature comforts and features, our
                primary focus has always been to make the fastest cars in
                the world. The Regera continues this tradition, but with
                innovative technology that blends outrageous speed,
                supreme comfort, and a unique Direct Drive experience.</p>

            <p class="msg">
                The Jesko model range is named after Jesko von
                Koenigsegg, the father of company Founder and CEO,
                Christian von Koenigsegg.

                They feature a redesigned 5.0 litre twin-turbo V8 engine
                producing 1280 hp on standard gasoline and 1600 hp on
                E85 biofuel (in some markets) alongside the revolutionary
                new 9-speed Koenigsegg Light Speed Transmission (LST)
                system. Advanced aerodynamics offer over 1000 kg of
                downforce, making it the ultimate track weapon.?</p>
